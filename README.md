# Guild42 MicroPython Demo

Demo application for Pyboard D files, used at presentation at Guild42

The application reads a accelerometer from I2C and represents the rotation on a LED36-Tile. 
In addition, a static single-page-application from the SD-card is hosted over the WLan-Access-Point 'Guild42Mp'. 

Use flash.py to copy all necessary files, connect to the websocket and open http://192.168.4.1/index.html

_Note that this should code should represent a __Prototype__ Application!_
